                     <p>Formula One currently uses 1.6 litre four-stroke turbocharged 90 degree V6 double-overhead camshaft (DOHC) reciprocating engines.[4] They were introduced in 2014 and have been developed over the subsequent seasons.</p>

                  <p>The power a Formula One engine produces is generated by operating at a very high rotational speed, up to 20,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). However, they are electronically limited to 15,000 as of the 2014 season.[5] This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size, which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Ford Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar.[6] Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power required to drive the camshaft and the valves to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault in 1986,[7][8] which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have an extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers have used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000 rpm.</p>

                  <p>The Mercedes V6 Hybrid Formula One engine, is a series of 1.6-liter, hybrid turbocharged V6 racing engines which features both a kinetic energy recovery system (MGU-K) and a heat energy recovery system (MGU-H), developed and produced by Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains for use in Formula One. The engines were in use since the 2014 season by the Mercedes works team. Over years of development, engine power was increased from 840 horsepower at 15,000 rpm, to 1,070 horsepower at 15,000 rpm. Customer team engines were used by Williams, McLaren, Lotus, Manor Racing, Force India, Racing Point Force India, Racing Point and Aston Martin.</p>
